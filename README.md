# Block ðŸ“¦

## I'm reworking this repo in the /rework branch
## Ignore this readme

## What and why
I'm planning for block to be a lightweight platform-as-a-service framework. 

This idea came to me because of my curiosity for the cloud, scaling, automation and my love for projects that are way to ambitious for a single developer. 
I think services such as DigitalOcean's App Platform, Azure's App Service and Platform.sh etc are a great feat of engineering and I wish to learn at least a little more of how this is done.

Join me on this journey of creating Block!

## Technical stack
The project has only just started, but my plan is to write most of the source code with GoLang, this way I can improve my GoLang skillset. I've been using JavaScript/TypeScript/NodeJs religiously for the past 5 years and I thinks it's time for a change.

## Scripts
I decided the best way to improve my Go skills is to write *everything* in Go, inluding helper scripts. Some scripts would definetly have made more sense to be written for bash.

## Feature list and progress
A list of progress on the project and planned features that need to be made to make Block a reality.

### Block
Core functionality of a Block such as services that monitor, setup and log what happens on a Block.

- [x] VPS Simulator docker image
